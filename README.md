# DroneML

QGIS plugin for drone image classification using machine learning.

## Installation (prototype)

Dowload the [ZIP file of DroneML](https://nlesc-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/o_ku_esciencecenter_nl/ETVp8wcBhJ1Com3PDohe5eQB219nCHs6wJURJymwqR6uRw?e=lOYkvn).

In QGIS, go to `Plugins` > `Python Console`.

Then, go to `Plugins` > `Manage and Install Plugins...` > `Install from ZIP` and select the downloaded `droneml.zip` file   

### Manual Installation if install from ZIP fails

Clone the repository of DroneML from GitHub:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:DroneML/segmentmytif.git
```

**Before ** copy the clonne `droneml` folder to the QGIS plugins directory. Examples on different operating systems:

- Windows: `C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins\`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins/`
- MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins/`

Then, go to `Plugins` > `Manage and Install Plugins...`. You will see the DroneML plugin in the list of installed plugins.
By checking the box, QGIS will start to install the Python dependencies required by the plugin.
A command prompt will appear, showing the progress of the installation. Upon completion, the plugin will be ready to use.
